Although we refrain from broadcasting our figures, the internet is abuzz with speculative numbers. To uphold our commitment to genuineness and truth, we regard these numbers as they are... mere estimates :D.

                    <h1 className="text-l ">BeenHere is a canvas for our users — whether it’s delving into the daily adventures of your grandparents or keeping the camaraderie alive with your cherished friends scattered worldwide, BeenHere aims to bridge the geographic divide, connecting you to your dear ones.


                    </h1 >   <h1 className="text-l ">We pledge a free-access platform with BeenHere, devoid of advertisements. The thought of incorporating ads or the manner in which we contemplate monetizing the app may cross your mind. Our foremost aim is to remain your go-to platform for as long as you will have us, and aligning with brands isn&apos;t on our priority list. A plethora of exciting features are on our drawing board, and we&apos;re incredibly fortunate to have the liberty to focus our energies on such aspirations. We promise, when it&apos;s time to unveil further plans, you&apos;ll be the first to know.
